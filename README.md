git clone https://github.com/kihuni/Payment-Gateway-API.git
cd Payment-Gateway-API
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  

On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

```

3. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

4. Add environment variables
   
Create a .env file:
